No cold is not as cold.

BUT...

When you live there for a long time your body gets use to the no moisture.

So cold... year after year...

Starts to feel more cold.

And before you know it. Cold... that may not be crazy cold... is cold again.

Remember your body acclimates.

Ok I lied...

You body does not acclimate to humidity. Bad humidity always feels terrible no matter what.
