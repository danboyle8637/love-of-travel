So I have our marketing site and blog running great.

I'm using NextJS for my framework. I love it.

I'm using Sanity.io for my CMS. I thought I loved it.

Little did I know... they have a trap set and it either forces you to switch services or bite the upgrade from nothing to $200 per month.

(or you could play with settings games but things get really dicy if you do that... not good for the long term.)

### Here's What Happened

I use Sanity at the moment for blog posts and nearly all of my site content.

That means landing pages and one off pages.

Things like:

* Home page...
* About...
* Contact...
* Product pages...
* etc...

And like I said landing pages.

Messing around with images...
