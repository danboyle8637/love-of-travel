Growing up in a small town in Wisconsin, I never thought about the possibility of owning a business or traveling places far away.

I was 21 when I first saw the ocean. Two girlfriends and I drove straight for 24 hours to Daytona Beach for spring break. I hadn’t been out of the Midwest much prior to that.

Fast forward over 20 years and I have been to 15 countries, 4 continents, 46 states; living in 8 of them and driving across country 12 times.

I have experienced things I never thought I would have. From walking on the Great Wall of China to standing on a dormant volcano in Panama looking at the Pacific and Atlantic ocean at the same time, the list is long and full.

I found roots for awhile as an entrepreneur making goat milk skin products and tending to a herd of goats. When a person farms livestock they are not traveling far as those goats take up all of your time.

The knowledge gained from that experience is close to the same type of knowledge you gain from traveling. An experience is an experience and I wouldn’t trade the years I gave to that herd of goats for anything. There are times I think I learned everything I needed to know about life from a herd of goats.

But those days are behind me now and I am back on the International travel train. The next stop is a Mt. Kilimanjaro climb. This will be continent number 5 and country 16, 17, and 18.

I met my husband about 4 years ago and we are in the early stages of building a glamping spa in the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee. We visited the area last year for my birthday for a long weekend and came across a property we liked.

We purchased it on a whim. It was a true gut decision, we just knew it was something we needed to do. This is how Smoky Mountain Glamping Spa was born. We sat and brainstormed together. You see, my husband is a general contractor that loves to do creative renovations and I am a massage therapist and esthetician by licensure and trade.

Each spot will be built unique and the build out will be catalogued here, along with the areas hiking trails and things to do.

It is my intention with this blog to also inspire you to travel and travel a lot. As much as you can. For as long as you can. There is no better time than RIGHT NOW! You just have to allow yourself to go. It is really that simple.
